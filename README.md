# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is a collection of board games from the BoardGameGeek (BGG) website as of February 2021. BGG is the largest online collection of board game data which consists of data on more than 100,000 total games (ranked and unranked). The voluntary online community contributes to the site with reviews, ratings, images, videos, session reports and live discussion forums on the expanding database of board games. This data set contains all ranked games (~20,000) as of the date of collection from the BGG database. Unranked games are ignored as they have not been rated by enough BGG users (a game should receive at least 30 votes to be eligible for ranking).


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

The sketch on the left is a bar chart that flexibly compares a number of features against average board game rating. The idea behind this visualization is that the msot relevant information is a board game's ranking, so users will likely want to know how each attribute compares to the ranking. The checkboxes to the right of the bar chart will allow the user to select what attribute they want to visualize in relation to average rating. The sketch on the right is a clustered bar chart depicting the quantity of games with certain mechanics over the years. In practice I will likely split the years into decades to reduce clutter. The most popular board game mechanics will be color coded and displayed next to eachother to show quantity in each decade. My first iteration of the idea was a stacked bar chart, but I think this is more clear to viewers.

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
